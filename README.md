# UEFA-Euros-2024-Players-Project
This Project is based off a dataset found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/damirdizdarevic/uefa-euro-2024-players). It includes every player in the Euro 2024 tournament, how old they are, how many caps, how many goals and more. 
Initially, I created a pyhton file to check out the dataset and complete a couple of initial ideas before I created a Power BI file as a visualisation.
The objective of the Power BI dashboard is to give the user an idea of how age, goals and market value range throughout different countries, clubs and caps. 
The dashboard is best used on Power BI since it is interactive, however a PDF version is also in the respiritory for a less interactive viewing experience.
